# Conditionals and Decisions!

# Get a number from the user.
user_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Use if/elif/else to check the number.

#update the if condition to check if the number if greater than 10
if True:
    print("That's a big number!")
# Replace the "True" after elif in the next condition to ACTUALLY check if the number is between 1 and 10.
elif True:
    print("That's a number between 1 and 10.")
#add an else condition to print that the number is small :)
