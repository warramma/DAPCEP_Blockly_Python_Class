# Loops are for repetition!

# Part 1: For Loop
# Use a for loop to print "Hello" 5 times.
# Uncomment the for loop ⬇️⬇️⬇️
# for i in _______________:
#     print("Hello")

# Part 2: While Loop
# A simple guessing game.
secret_number = 7
tries = 3
guess = 0

while True: #update this so it checks if there are tries remaining
    # Get user input.
    guess = int(input("Guess the secret number: "))

    if True: ##check if the guess is right!
      print('You got it!')
      break
    #now add TWO conditions to check if the guess is too LOW & if the guess is too HIGH
