# DAPCEP_Blockly_Python_Class
Exercises for hybrid Blockly &amp; Python class combining block-based and text-based coding to teach fundamental cs concepts

**Grade Levels:** 4th - 8th

**Course Description:** This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of computer programming using a hybrid approach, starting with visual block-based programming in Blockly to understand core concepts, then translating those ideas into the powerful text-based language, Python.

## Student Outcomes: 
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts like algorithms and variables.
- Translate visual programming logic from Blockly into Python code.
- Use code to make decisions with conditionals (if/else) and repeat actions with loops (for/while).
- Organize their programs with functions and manage data with lists.
- Combine what they've learned to create a complete project.

## Required Tools
- Access to [Blockly Games](https://blockly.games/)
- Access to [Blockly Demo](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html)
- Access to Python Environment (we will use Google Colab)

# Syllabus
## Week 1: Intro + Algorithms, Variables, and Data Types
**Main Objective:** Introduction to class, instructors, go over norms and expectations, take the pre-test, learn what an algorithm is and how to store information using variables.

### Activities
- [Blockly Maze Game](https://blockly.games/maze)
- In Blockly - Create a program that sets a name variable to your name and an age variable to your age. Display a message like "Hello [name], you are [age] years old."
- In Python - Translating Blockly's set variable to variable = value and understanding basic data types (int, str).

## Week 2: Conditionals and Logical Operators
**Main Objective:** Make decisions in your code using if/else and combine conditions with and/or.
### Activities
- In Blockly - Create a program that asks the user for a number. Use an if/else block to determine if the number is greater than 10.
- In Blockly - Modify the program to check if the number is between 1 and 10 using the and operator.
- In Python - Translating Blockly's conditional blocks to if/elif/else statements with proper indentation.

## Week 3: Loops & User Input
**Main Objective:** Repeat code with for and while loops, and learn how to get input from the user.
### Activities
- [Blockly Turtle](https://blockly.games/turtle?lang=en)
- In Blockly - Create a simple guessing game using a repeat while loop.
- In Python - Translating Blockly's repeat to for loops and repeat while to while loops.

## Week 4: Functions & Simple Lists
**Main Objective:** Reuse code with functions and store multiple items in a list.
### Activities
- [Blockly Music](https://blockly.games/music?lang=en)
- In Blockly - Create a function to print a name and greeting!
- In Blockly - Create a list of your 3 favorite things. Use a loop to print each item.
- In Python - Translating Blockly procedures to def functions and creating and iterating through lists.
